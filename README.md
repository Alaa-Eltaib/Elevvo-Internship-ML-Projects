## Projects  

### 1. Student Performance Prediction  
- Predict students’ exam scores based on academic, social, and personal factors.  
- Applied data cleaning, encoding, feature engineering, and regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM).  
- R² close to 1.0 after feature engineering.  

---

### 2. Forest Cover Type Classification  
- Predict forest cover type using the UCI Covertype dataset (581k records, 54 features).  
- Used Random Forest and XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning.  
- Accuracy: Random Forest ~95%, XGBoost ~96–97%.

### 3. Loan Approval Prediction  
- Predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected (Kaggle dataset).  
- Handled imbalanced data with SMOTE, evaluated using Precision, Recall, and F1-score.  
- Built an interactive GUI with Streamlit for live predictions.

### 4. Customer Segmentation  
- Cluster mall customers into groups based on income and spending score.  
- Applied K-Means clustering with Elbow method and visualized customer segments.  
- Tested DBSCAN as an alternative clustering method.
